/**
 * This class defines the material and its properties
 *
 * Nominal abstraction:
 * The class Material represents a real-world conceptâ€”a material with a name and its acquisition cost.
 * Instead of working directly with raw strings and numbers to represent a material, the concept is abstracted
 * into a single, cohesive class.
 * By giving the abstraction a name (Material), the class provides a clear and logical representation.
 *
 * Data Abstraction
 * The Material class encapsulates its key data:
 * name: the material's name.
 * acquisitionCost: the cost of acquiring the material, represented using a CostContainer object.
 * The fields name and acquisitionCost are private, hiding the internal state from external access.
 *
