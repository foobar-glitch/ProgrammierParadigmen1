## Questions
### Building
1. When demolishing the building, can I recycle both renovation
renovation construct or only the shell construct?
2. Ageing only affects the renovation construct right?

3. update() -> Apartment.java && age() -> Building.java
   could return the Cost of that timefame (year) ?
